I've been watching the clips from last night's episode of Saturday Night Live, and they look pretty awesome. I was planning on watching the show live, but before I knew it I was checking the time and it was already midnight, and I knew I had probably missed all of the good stuff.

This weekend's episode featured a spoof of the first few weeks of President Trump's presidency. In it, Mr. Trump, portrayed by Alec Baldwin, makes several phone calls to different countries which go disastrously wrong.

Next was a spoof of the daily press briefings with an impersonation of Sean Spicer by Melissa Mcarthy.
